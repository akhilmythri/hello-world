# hello-world
First Github repository! 

This is my first trial run with creating a repository on GitHub, it seems like a great way of collaborating with people! 
I m learning this as part of the Data Science Course by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

Learning in the times of Corona! Simulataneously insane and sanity-preserving!
